# ‚úàÔ∏è Airport Management

## Overview

This project aims to develop a flight data management system for an airline. The system handles data related to airports, flights, and airline information, including entities such as Airport and Flight, along with an Airport Manager to oversee airports.<br><br>

The system includes various functions for efficient management of flight data, encompassing flight details, aircraft types, and airport information.

## Features

### üè¢ **Airport Management**
- `isSameAirport`: Check if two airports are the same.<br>
- `isAirportName`: Verify if a given name matches an airport's name.<br>
- `addAirport`: Add a new airport to the system.<br>
- `findAirportByName`: Locate an airport by its name.<br><br>

### ‚úàÔ∏è **Flight Management**
- `isFlightFromSourceName`: Check if a flight departs from a specific source airport.<br>
- `isFlightToDestName`: Verify if a flight arrives at a specific destination airport.<br>
- `isPlaneCodeInFlight`: Determine if a specific plane code is used in a flight.<br>
- `isPlaneTypeInFlight`: Check if a specific plane type is used in a flight.<br>
- `addFlight`: Add a new flight to the system.<br>
- `doPrintFlightsWithPlaneCode`: Print flights that use a specific plane code.<br>
- `doPrintFlightsWithPlaneType`: Print flights that use a specific plane type.<br>
- `doCountFlightsFromName`: Count the number of flights departing from a specific airport.<br><br>

### üè¢ **Airline Management**
- Stores the company name, number of flights, and an array of flights.<br>
- Additional functions may be required to further optimize the system.<br><br>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
